# 🐳 Node.js To-Do App with Docker Swarm

A simple, containerized to-do list app built with Express and EJS — deployed using Docker Swarm inside WSL with Docker-in-Docker simulation.

## 🚀 Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Sanitized inputs to prevent XSS
- Method override for PUT requests
- EJS templating for dynamic views
- Dockerized and Swarm-ready
- Fully automated deployment script

---

## 🧠 DevOps Journey

This project was born from a real-world debugging challenge:

- ❌ Docker Desktop blocked IP binding
- ❌ WSL gave `Empty reply from server`
- ❌ Swarm manager lost state after container restart
- ✅ Patched app to bind to `0.0.0.0`
- ✅ Rebuilt image and redeployed stack
- ✅ App responded and rendered `/todo` in browser

All automated via `deploy-todo-swarm.sh`.
